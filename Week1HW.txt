A GUI (graphical user interface) is more reliant on visuals and actions for interaction with a computer system, while a CLI (command-line interface) is reliant on text only for functions. While GUIs are typically easier to navigate for the common user, CLIs are more complicated and require further knowledge of computer commands, and as such are typically used for administrator functions and software development. CLIs may seem primitive to many users, but they allow for more control over a computer system than a GUI does. GUIs are meant simply for ease of use and typically can't execute difficult tasks easily, while CLIs can do so using only a few commands from the user. GUIs also take up more processing power and run slower than CLIs, mainly due to the many graphical features that GUIs have for easy use. CLIs are more recognizable as solid black backgrounds with white or green text, as often seen in media. CLIs use, and therefore require, marginally less processing power. However, as good as CLIs may seem, they are difficult to learn to use, with no visual confirmation for successful tasks, a need for accurate typing, and a lack of attractive design that GUIs have, part of the reason the latter are so appealing to most users.
