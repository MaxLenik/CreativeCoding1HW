For my final project, I am going to make a music visualizer set to "Challengers: Match Point" by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I aim to have the album cover in the background, and have it move with the bass of the song. To do this, I will have to learn how to create a music visualizer in the first place, which will require much research. I have full confidence that I will be able to do it regardless. I can't say I have any influences save for the artists of the music, which has had my creative gears turning since the first time I heard it.
