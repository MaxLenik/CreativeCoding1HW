I found Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture to be incredibly inspiring. In an increasingly insane world, it’s hard to think about chasing your childhood dreams when you’re not sure everything will line up for that to happen. But hearing from a guy who did a darn good job of achieving his dreams in his much too short life is reassuring, and gives me hope that I can do that too. Being this young, I know I have at least 30 more years ahead of me to do great things, and yet I have my doubts about if I can even get to a basic position in the film industry. I constantly see examples of movies failing in theaters and movie studios flubbing production and releases, and it makes me fearful for any future projects I work on. But inspiration, reaffirming words like Randy Pausch’s in this video are sometimes what I need to be ensured that I’ll achieve success in the movie industry.
